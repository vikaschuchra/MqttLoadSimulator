# MqttLoadSimulator
Basic MQTT Load Simulator. All configurations can be done in a single configuration file config.js. 

Configuration comprises of three sections:
First, you can configure URL, Port and Topic.
Second, you can define load parameters (Requests/Second and Total Requests to send)
Finally, you can customize the payload. It will randomly pick properties to be sent in the payload.

Happy testing.
